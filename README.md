# Hey!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Ege, my github user name is @gipoezcan
- 👀 I’m writing this because the template has cool emojis
- 🌱 I’m currently mainly teaching, being a front-end architect, I'm jumping in anything new to see the trade-offs people took
- 💞️ I’m looking for people with very good JS skills, and because of a twist of fate, JSF people too!
- 📫 you can send an email at my address ending with @gipmbh.de, starting with my username without the gip part.
